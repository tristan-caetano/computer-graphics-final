## This is a simple scene that contains a large field, models, an animated model, and various lighting methods.

### Unfortunately, not every model could be uploaded due to GitHubs maximum storage for individual files.
#### Should you want to use this scene for any reason, contact me for remaining models, or substitite with your own models.

### None of these models are my own and were acquired from various model repo websites for free.
#### All models were acquired legally, and this scene is not being used for commercial purposes.

##### This project was created solely in Visual Studio Code using the Live Server extension to view the scene in a local server.
